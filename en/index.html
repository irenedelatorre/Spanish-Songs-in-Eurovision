        <p>
            This year 2022, Spain changed the system for choosing its 
            Eurovision Spanish song. To get the public involved months before 
            the European contest, RTVE (Spanish Radio and Television 
            Corporation) organized the Benidorm Fest, a musical competition 
            with three ceremonies: two semifinals and one final. 
            The candidate got chosen with both votes from the audience and 
            votes from a professional jury.
        </p>
        <p>
            The winning song was the one proposed by the artist 
            <span class="female num">Chanel Terrero</span>.
            She rose as the winner against the other two big favorites, 
            <span class="female num">Rigoberta Bandini</span> and
            <span class="female num">Tanxugueiras</span>,
            thanks to the votes from the professional jury. Her selection 
            caused a lot of commotion in the audience, who had mainly 
            supported the song <span class="italic">Terra</span> from the 
            Galician group <span class="female num">Tanxugueiras</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the controversy was not only about the voting system. 
            The three proposals mentioned before, led all by female artists, 
            offered very diverse representations of women. 
            <span class="female num">Rigoberta Bandini's</span>
            <span class="italic">Ay Mama</span>
            reclaimed work produced by mothers and the taboos around 
            female bodies; <span class="female num">Tanxugueiras's</span>
            <span class="italic">Terra</span>
            the importance of tradition and Galician women; 
            <span class="female num">Chanel's</span> 
            <span class="italic">SloMo</span>, 
            the most sensual and, according to some critics, 
            hyper sexualizing facet in women.

        <p>
            While part of the public censured <span class="italic">SloMo</span> 
            for being sexist and misogynistic, the other side considered it 
            another representation of what it means to be an empowered woman. 
            The debate focused on the song, dance, and femininity of the 
            performance, but the team behind the song -composers and lyricists 
            in charge of the proposal- went largely unnoticed. And, can you 
            speak about female empowerment if the songs have been composed by 
            mostly masculine teams, even if they are defended by female artists? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each year is more important to have songs that are fair 
            representations of society, both in terms of the messages 
            being communicated and the team that produces them. 
            And in terms of diversity between male and female performers, 
            the Spanish representation in Eurovision is rather balanced. 
            <span class="female num">
                43% of the songs that participated in the contest were 
                performed by female singers or groups. 
            </span>
            This is a very similar percentage to the number of interpretations 
            done by male singers or groups, <span class="male num">46%</span>. 
            Spain has only participated with songs done by mixed groups 
            <span class="mixed num">seven times</span>.

            These numbers change drastically when one inspects the teams 
            behind the music and lyrics. Only 
            <span class="female num">11%</span> of all lyricists that have 
            participated in the Spanish songs have been women. 
            Or what it's the same, 
            <span class="female num">
                only 9 out of the 61 candidates had female lyricists.
                The number lowers to 9% if we speak about musical composers.
            </span>
             Among them is <span class="female num">María José de Cerato</span>,
             composer of the 1969 winning song

            Curiously enough, <span class="italic">SloMo</span> is one of the 
            few songs in the Eurovision-Spanish list that has a woman in its 
            team, <span class="female num">Maggie Szabo</span>. With her, there 
            are also 
            <span class="male num">Arjen Thonen, Ibere Fortes, 
                Keith Harris and Leroy Sánchez.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The other two favorites of the Benidorm Fest also had women as 
            songwriters. The lyrics of <span class="italic">Ay Mamá</span> are 
            signed by 
            <span class="male num">Esteban Navarro Dordal</span>, 
            <span class="female num">Rigoberta Bandini</span> and 
            <span class="male num">Stefano Maccarrone</span>
            <span>Terra</span>, by 
            <span class="female num">Aida Tarrío Torrado</span>, 
            <span class="male num">Iago Pico Freire</span>, 
            <span class="female num">Olaia Maneiro Argibay</span>, and
            <span class="female num">Sabela Maneiro Argibay.</span>
            Are they indications, maybe, that more women will appear not 
            only as singers but also as songwriters?
        </p>
        <h3>Other curiosities</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="male num">Juan Carlos Calderón</span> 
            has been the composer and lyricist that has participated the most 
            in Eurovision, four times: 
            <span class="mixed num">Mocedades's</span>
            <span class="italic">Eres tú</span> (1973), 
            <span class="mixed num">Sergio and Estíbaliz's</span>

            <span class="italic">Nacida para Amar</span> (1989). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The song with the highest number of composers and lyricists is
            <span class="male num">Rodolfo Chikilicuatre's</span> 
            <span class="italic">Baila el Chiki Chiki</span>
            (2008). A total of eleven people participated in the creation 
            of the song: 
            <span class="male num">
                Alberto Romero Tomás, Angel Cotobal Albaina, 
                Eduardo Dols Pérez Guillem, Jair Dominguez Torregrosa,

            For the groups that took part in Eurovision, 
            gender was included in the following way:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If all members of a group were men, they have been
